## Multiobjective optimization of (Aspect Ratio, Quasisymmetry)

`find_pareto_front.py` reads through the data and collects the points `X` and function
values `FX` of pareto optimal data. This should be run after `eps_con.py` to accumulate
a pickle file of pareto optimal points. These points are used for warm starting `eps_con.py`
and `predictor_corrector.py`.

We principly use the epsilon constraint method for minimizing quasisymmetry subject 
to an inequality constraint on aspect ratio. This code is in `eps_con.py`. `eps_con.py`
can be submitted on graphite via the submission script `batch_submit_eps_con.py`.
If `warm=True` then the script will warm start from the pareto optimal point with aspect
ratio nearest `aspect_target`. So you must make sure that you have run `find_pareto_front.py`
at some point before the run starts, in order to generate the pickle file with the 
pareto front.

The second method we use is a local expansion for locally exploring the pareto front
This code is in `predictor_corrector.py` and can be sumbbit to G2 via
`batch_submit_predictor_corrector.py`. This script starts its iteration from points on the 
pareto front, so `find_pareto_front.py` should be run at some point before running 
`predictor_corrector.py`. 

`make_plot_data.py` will read through the data and make a pickle file with all of the function
evaluations. 

`plot.py` plots the data from `make_plot_data.py`.

`select_points_for_matt.py` is a useful script to select pareto optimal points from the pickle
file generated by `find_pareto_front.py`. You put in a desired aspect ratio in it returns you
the pareto optimal point nearest that aspect ratio.
